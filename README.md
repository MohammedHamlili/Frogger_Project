"# Frogger_Project"
- Project date: November-December 2021.
- Technologies used:
1. Language Used = Assembly Language (MIPS)
2. IDE = MARS4.5 (a lightweight interactive IDE that allows programming in Assembly MIPS). It is intended to be used as a MIPS Simulator (it simulates the bitmap display and and keyboard input of a MIPS processor).

- Program objective: Implement the popular arcade game Frogger using MIPS assembly. A classical version of the game can be found here:
https://froggerclassic.appspot.com/

To play my implementation of the game, you can load the Assembly code file (.asm) in the MARS4.5 software and simulate it.
You can find more complete details in the handout pdf file of this project.
